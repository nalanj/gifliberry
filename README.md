# gifliberry-starter-pack
A basic jekyll theme for sharing your GIFs.

if you've ever seen a cool directory listing based GIF site like http://bukk.it and thought hey, I really want one of those for my own GIFs, then gifliberry-starter-pack is for you. It'll give you a Jekyll powered GIF index that you can share on the static hosting provider of your choice.

# Installation

The easiest way to get started is simply to fork this repo on GitHub. Once it's
forked, go to Settings and rename your new repository. Then clone the new repo
to your computer and start adding GIFs!

# Adding GIFs

To add GIFs, just toss them into the root directory of the project. Seriously,
that's it.

# Sharing

To share your GIFs, you'll need to host them somewhere. GitHub pages is a great
option.

To share them on GitHub pages, just create a new branch called `gh-pages` and
push it to your repository. Since gifliberry is Jekyll powered GitHub will
automatically generate the correct index file.

# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, fork this project (but don't add any GIFs), make
the changes you'd like to contribute, and then submit a Pull Request.
